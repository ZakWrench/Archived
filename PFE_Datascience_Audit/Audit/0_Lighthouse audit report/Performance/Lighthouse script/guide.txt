create json file called budget containing the following script:
[
  {
    "path": "/*",
    "timings": [
      {
        "metric": "interactive",
        "budget": 3000
      },
      {
        "metric": "first-meaningful-paint",
        "budget": 1000
      }
    ],
    "resourceSizes": [

        "budget": 125
      },
      {
        "resourceType": "total",
        "budget": 300

    "resourceCounts": [
      {
        "resourceType": "third-party",
        "budget": 10
      }
