8 years of range

taking into account that the population of adolescents between the age of 14 an 19 is 49542(25423 are boys, 24117 are girls)
we would estimate that the mean population between the age of 17 to 25 is 49542 / 5 = 9908 -> 9908 * 8 = 79267, basing on the median age of the total population between the age of 0 to 19 which is 197562(50126 age 0-4, 51665 age 5-9, 49542 age 10-14, 46229 age 15-19), the median age of 5 years difference is 49390

median price of families: assuming the parents makes somewhere between 8000(6000) to 15000 in public schools, and between 10000 to 22000 in private schools, 

bac: taking a range between 18-19 of age, around 18000 students plus an estimate of 800-1000 students who happens to change their school or field to a new one,

CATEGORY: >10000 -> the more wage the more people can afford. wage + scholarship (20-40% of parent wage)
hypothese: expanses of tuition is third of parent's revenue. we have created a variable to determine whether they can afford or not.
