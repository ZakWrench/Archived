Three types of missing data:
1-MCAR(Missing Completely at Random):Data that is missing completely at random.
2-MAR:Data that is missing at random
3-MNAR: Data that is missing not at random


NA is different from zero or blank values, and represent Missing values.

Aggregate funcions summarize the data in dataset.
examples: Mean/average, Median, Maximun/Minimum, Sum.


Duplicated rows aren't necessarily incorrect. They may be valid. for example two different person having the same name, or the same customer ordering different products.
Identical Rows: remove completely identical rows using the unique() function.
Overlapping Rows: Remove duplicative(but not identical) records by filtering out the incorrect values(manually)

mutate create a variable or modify an existing one.

When it comes to currencies, we must identify the type of the currency. And also the formatting of currency values may cause issues when importing data.
