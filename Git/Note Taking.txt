Version Management/Control: Control&Tracking of code changes over time.
-Multiple Files approach: first draft, second draft.. final.

Git: Version Control System - Manage Code History - Track Changes
Github: Largest development Platform - Cloud Hosting & Collaboration Priver - Git Repository Hosting

Course Content: Git: Commit & Branches (The basics) - Merging, Rebasing & and More Deep Dive
Github: Local Vs Remote Repositories(Basics) - Pull requests, Organizations & More Deep Dive
---------------------------------


Working Dir/tree: index.html, styles.css, files... the files that meant to be managed by GIT
Repository: .git(hidden): Staging Area(Index file), Commits(Objects Folder) contain all commit snapshots
Master Branch:
Stagin Area:


Add file -> commit file

commit : snapshot in the end "snapshot1:add file1/2/3" -> "snapshot2:file3 change" -> "snapshot3:add file4"
git store all this changes in the master(main) BRANCH that contains all changes made on the project.

working dir(styles.css) -> staging area(style.css) hey these changes should be part of the next commit -> commit 

git means tracking changes not storing files again and again

---------------

Branches: there's master branch that represent the live app/website, and then copy of the branch to add modifications before live implementation.
merging branches
-------------

git add: adds it to the staging area
 --------
 head is the latest commit.
 detached-head is when you working on a specific commit via its id: git checkout id
 
--

git switch is specific to working on branches

---

when deleting a file in the working directory, the file is still in the staging area

----
Detached head state when checkout a specific commit with id
----
Tracked - Untracked - Ignore
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep Dive:

Stash: Where you can save uncommited unstaged changes.
Reflog: last 30 days of changes.
Rebasing: creates new commits with new ids
